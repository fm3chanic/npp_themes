## fm3chanic Themes for Notepad++

This repository contains all color themes for Notepad++ I've created so far.<br>
Themes which have been created during my project of color theming Vtubers are in the directory "vtuber_project". The directory "other" contains all color themes which where created outside of the project.

### Installation:

To install a theme download the XML file or copy the content in your text editor of choice and save it as XML. 
Copy the XML file in one of the directories below:

`C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\themes`

for a local installation

***OR***

`C:\Program Files\Notepad++\themes`

for a machine wide installation (admin rights might be required)

> [!NOTE]
> The themes come **without** a general font and font size setting.
> You need to setup a font and font size of your liking in the "Default Style" area of style settings to make the theme usable.

### Contribution:

If you want to help maintaining the themes, please use colors from the according color scheme. You can find the scheme files in the repo linked above.
