## fm3chanic Themes for Notepad++

This repository contains all color themes for Notepad++ I've created.
Themes which have been created during my project of color theming Vtubers are in the folder "vtuber_project". The folder "other" contains all color themes which where created outside of the project.

### Project:

I am working in IT sector in one of the larger corporations and the options for supported text editors are very limited. Therefore I am only using Notepad++ during work. Switching themes according to mood and task is something I do regularly, but the number of maintained themes for Notepad++ is very low.
So I decided one day, I am building my own theme. At the end the result was a theme based on an anime character  (Sakura Haruno from Naruto). This was basically the day where the idea for my current project was born.

When a theme based on an anime character is possible, then a theme based on a Vtuber would also be possible. So why not creating a theme based on a Vtuber. But which one? 
At his point I had already more than 10 content creators in mind, so instead of trying to choose one of them I made a project out of it.

### Installation:

To install a theme download the XML file or copy the content in your text editor of choice and save it as XML. 
Copy the XML file in one of the folders below:

*C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\themes*

for a local installation

*OR*

*C:\Program Files\Notepad++\themes*

for a machine wide installation (admin rights might be required)

### Contribution:

If you want to help maintaining the themes, please use colors from the according color scheme. The color scheme files are stored in this repo: https://github.com/fm3chanic/color_schemes
