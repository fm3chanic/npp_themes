## fm3chanic Themes for Notepad++

This repository contains all color themes for Notepad++ I've created.
Themes which have been created during my project of color theming Vtubers are in the folder "vtuber_project". The folder "other" contains all color themes which where created outside of the project.

### Project:

I am working in IT sector in one of the larger corporations and the amout of options for text editors are very limited. Therefore I am only using Notepad++ during work. Switching themes according to mood and task is something I do regularly, but the amout of maintained themes for Notepad++ is very low.
So I decided one day, I am building my own theme. At the end the result was a theme based on an anime character  (Sakura Haruno from Naruto). This was basically the day where the idea for my current project was born.

When an anime character is possible, then a theme based on a Vtuber would also be possible. So why not creating a theme based on a Vtuber. But which one? 
At his point I had already more than 10 content creators in mind, so instead of trying to choose one of them I made a project out of it.

### Installation:

To install a theme download the XML file or copy the content in your text editor of choice and save it as XML. 
Copy the XML file in one of the folders below:

*C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\themes*

for a local installation

*OR*

*C:\Program Files\Notepad++\themes*

for a machine wide installation (admin rights might be required)

### Contribution:

I accept all fixes, required updates (sometimes a theme looses compatibility after an update) and extension of the supported languages for all themes covered in this repo.
Please only use colors from the according color scheme. The color schemes are stored in this repo: https://github.com/fm3chanic/color_schemes
 
Exception for this is the "Sakura Haruno" theme, which was one of my first themes I have created and maintained for myself, therefore no color scheme files was created. 

Please sent pull requests one theme at the time so it's easier for me to check your changes. Thanks for understanding.
